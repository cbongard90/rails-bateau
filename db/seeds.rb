# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# puts "Destroying previous database"
# Category.destroy_all
# Subject.destroy_all
# User.destroy_all

# puts "Seeding database..."

# puts "Creating categories..."
# category1 = Category.create!(name: "Science")
# category2 = Category.create!(name: "Mathematical Science")

# puts "Creating 1 teacher"
# teacher = User.create!(email: "teacher@test.com", password: "password", first_name: "Teacher", last_name: "Test", teacher: true)


# puts "Creating 2 students"
# student1 = User.create!(email: "student1@test.com", password: "password", first_name: "Student1", last_name: "Test", teacher: false)
